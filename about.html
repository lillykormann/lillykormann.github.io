      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I am a first year PhD student in Astrophysics at the University of Vienna, with a focus on the 3D structure of the local ISM. 
        Currently, I am mainly working with Gaia-based 3D dust maps, which make it possible to trace the distribution
        of dust and gas in more detail than ever before! 
      </p> 

      <p>
        Some of the 3D interactive figures related to my work can be found under the Research section of this website, I am always
        happy to chat about the visualization of 3D data and potential new tools.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the side, I am an editor for the Star Formation Newsletter. If you are interested in star formation, would 
        like to recieve the newsletter monthly, or want to submit a paper that fits the scope, feel free to visit us 
        at <a href="https://starformationnews.org" target="_blank">starformationnews.org</a>!
      </p>

      <p>
        This website is still a work in progress, so I will update it as I go :)
